    <p>This is a simple exercise to experiment and understand the very basics of webgl. The teapots all spin of grow in different ways. The center pot can be controlled with the x,z, and y keys. lowercase spins one wasy and uppercase spins them the other. At the bottom of the page are some text boxes and a slider to control the camera and the frustum. The camera can move between a value of -10 and -.5 while the near and far are limited to being between 0 and 10. </p>
    
    <p>This was not meant to be ported over to other programs. If you wish to see it them use the included files.

    <p>Learning webgl proved to be a difficult task as I was unfamilar with the style needed to use it properly. The concepts were understandable but putting them into action stumped me for a few days. Getting the teapots to move and instancing them was the easyist task as it works nearly the same as 2d does. The GLSL part was what was hardest for me to understand. I had help from a peer and he filled in some confusion I had and lead me in the right direction so I could come to the conclusion myself.</p>
    
    <p> All code was derived from a base code set given by Professor Bennett at Edinboro University. Modifications were made by me with help from Bruce Conrad.</p>
