    <p>A script that draws a dart board in a html canvas. It can be used on one or many canvases as long as the name given is valid. To use it simply call function Dartboard() with the name of the canvas in the argument. </a>
    
    <p>Problems I ran into were mostly things that were due to my bad thinking. I had the wrong outlook. I was using things like I was in a c++ class instead of how javascript works. I was lucky that the way I went about it would still work out just fine. I had to adjust some values to get it to spec when I relized you gave us measurements for the rings.</p>
    
    <p>This code has a few ways it could be improved as I learn more about javascript. There is some places that could be trimmed and made to look and probably function better. More functionality could also be added to the dartboard call itself, such as line and fill colors.
