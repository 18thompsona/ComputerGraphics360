    <p>A simple mad libs program written in javascript. The story is a short story about getting advice on your driving exam. The words needed are 3 adjectives, one adverb, 6 nouns, and one plural noun. The story is hardcoded into the script. The source of the story is <a href="http://www.redkid.net/cgi-bin/madlibs/drivingtest.pl"> redkid mad libs.</a>
    <p>The problems in the game are mostly due to how simple the game is. Everything is hardcoded in as im still getting used to javascript and html. Lots or repetative code but I didn't want to go crazy with the first program, so I just copy pasted the same do while loop. This should be fixable with a function and an array and return the given answer to be set after removing a space at the end and the begining if it is there to help with formating.</p>
