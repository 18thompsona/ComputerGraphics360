    <p>A package of scripts that creates a interactive scene in the html canvas. It consists of the main scene and 7 javascript classes. To set up the program simply provide a canvas that is a square, however the things to see will become more and more spaced out the larger you go and more ontop of each other the smaller you go. Call the setup function with the canvas name as the argument. After that the scene can be controlled with the a and j keys(to move left) and the d and l keys(to move right). Animations will be playing by default but these can be turned off with the q key. </a>
    
    <p>I found some issues later but starting off it was more understandable. This was due to the object-oriented approach that was able to be done for this program that I find more comfortable. Having set up the classes for each drawable picture and testing them proved to give a smooth start. The actual scene itself had some issue due to this same approach. Making the scene a class did not want to play well for what I was trying to do. Many things would not work in the way I thought they would, so I had to turn these methods to functions. The timer was the main cause here as it does not like interacting with classes. Making the code scale with took me a while as well. This required mild reworks to the scene.</p>
    
    <p>This code could be improved with more things to look at the larger the canvas becomes and more ways to customize the stickman. I think that having something like a random color generator for them would add some cool variance.</p>
